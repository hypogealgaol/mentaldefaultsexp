This is the mental defaults experiment I worked on over the summer with base code
written by Stefan Uddenberg of Yale Cognition & Development Lab.

Feeds through Amazon Mechanical Turk sending a user the experiment, then uses the previous user's
response and feeds it to the next user like a game of telephone. 

Executable: xp1
